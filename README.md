# Indus Action: Online Automation Platform for Government Scheme Accessibility

## Project Overview

Indus Action is a dedicated NGO committed to bridging the gap between government schemes and the underprivileged communities who need them the most. Our mission is to empower vulnerable families by providing them with easy access to welfare entitlements, ensuring they receive the support they are entitled to.

This project focuses on automating the process of identifying, matching, and recommending relevant government schemes to potential beneficiaries. By leveraging modern web technologies, we have created a comprehensive platform that not only simplifies the process for users but also aids field workers in their outreach efforts.

## Key Features

1.  **Scheme Fetching and Scraping**:
    
    -   Our platform periodically fetches information about various government schemes directly from official websites using web scraping techniques.
    -   The fetched data is processed and categorized to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.
2.  **Scheme Matching and Recommendation**:
    
    -   Users' data is matched against the database of available schemes.
    -   The platform automatically suggests applicable schemes to users based on their profiles and needs.
    -   Detailed information about required documents and application procedures is provided.
3.  **User Registration and Management**:
    
    -   The platform supports user registration, allowing individuals to create profiles and update their information as needed.
    -   NGO field workers can register users on their behalf during community visits.
4.  **Field Worker Support**:
    
    -   Field workers are equipped with tools to manage their interactions with beneficiaries.
    -   They can update user information, track the progress of applications, and receive notifications about new schemes.
5.  **Multilingual Support**:
    
    -   To overcome language barriers, the platform supports multiple languages, ensuring accessibility for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
6.  **Notification System**:
    
    -   Users and field workers receive SMS notifications about new schemes, application statuses, and other important updates.
    -   Notifications are triggered based on changes in the database, such as the provisioning of new schemes by the government.
